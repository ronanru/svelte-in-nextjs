![Question on discord: Hi everyone, 
I was wondering if it's possible to use Svelte with Next.js? I know I need to use Next.js for SSR or else my site won't be fast enough (dan abrams said so) but also rich harris said the dom is pure overhead so i dont wanna use react. how can i slot in svelte instead? im sure there is a way...](image.png)
